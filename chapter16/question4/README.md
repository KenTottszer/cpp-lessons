Question #4

Modify the prior program so that the user can enter as many integers as they like. Stop accepting input when the user enters -1.

Print the vector and find the min and max elements.

When run with the input 3 8 5 2 3 7 -1, the program should produce the following output:

Enter numbers to add (use -1 to stop): 3 8 5 2 3 7 -1
With array ( 3, 8, 5, 2, 3, 7 ):
The min element has index 3 and value 2
The max element has index 1 and value 8
Do something reasonable when the user enters -1 as the first input.
