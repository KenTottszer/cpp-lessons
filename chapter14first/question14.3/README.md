Question #1

Create a struct called IntPair that holds two integers. Add a member function named print that prints the value of the two integers.

and produce the output:

p1: Pair(1, 2)
p2: Pair(3, 4)



Add a new member function to IntPair named isEqual that returns a Boolean indicating whether one IntPair is equal to another.

The following program function should compile: and produce the output:

p1: Pair(1, 2)
p2: Pair(3, 4)
p1 and p1 are equal
p1 and p2 are not equal
