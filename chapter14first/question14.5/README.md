Question #2

a) Write a class named Point3d. The class should contain:

Three private member variables of type int named m_x, m_y, and m_z;
A public member function named setValues() that allows you to set values for m_x, m_y, and m_z.
A public member function named print() that prints the Point in the following format: <m_x, m_y, m_z>

This should print:

<1, 2, 3>

b) Add a function named isEqual() to your Point3d class. The following code should run correctly:

This should print:

point 1 and point 2 are equal
point 1 and point 3 are not equal
